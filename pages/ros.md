Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source project that solves many of the common challenges that designing, simulating and building a robot has.
The project has greatly grown since its inception and it is nowadays one of the most important and interesting in technologies in the field of robotics.

There are many resources in the Internet regarding ROS usage, including, of course, the official tutorials in the [ROS webpage](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials). These are of course valuable and important resources for learning but here in [enesbot.me](http://enesbot.me) we wanted to present a more case-oriented approach with a clear context for beginners.
